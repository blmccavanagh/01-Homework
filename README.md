### Homework 01: Code Refactor

# Horiseon Website Code Refactor

## Outline:

Website for "Horiseon Social Solution Services" refactored:

* To better align with accessibility standards set by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI); in turn better supporting the use of assistive technologies.

* To improve search engine optimization (SEO).

## Design Notes:

Website title created and added to code. The title consists of the company's name and the primary services that it offers.

Non-semantic elements within the HTML replaced with semantic elements. This has several benefits including improved SEO and better optimisation for responsiveness on mobile devices. Code readability is also improved through the use of semantic HTML elements. 
Semantic HTML elements also allow for increased compatibility with assistive technologies allowing for a better user experience for people with disabilities.
To further enhance accessibility, descriptive alt text attributes for images have been added to the design. This allows screen readers to portray the information given by an image on a webpage. Decorative images and icons that do not convey functional information have been assigned null alt text values. Text values for these types of images would add audible clutter to a screen reader output or could distract users if the topic is different or irrelevant from that in the adjacent text. It also prevents the screen reader citing the file name of the image provided.
